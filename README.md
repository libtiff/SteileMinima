#**SteileMinima**
A graphical User Interface to help you construct and send the Confirmation of Movement message due to the corona virus outbreak.
This was meant to be a completely standalone confirmation requester but due to Google's policy regarding the SMSMANAGER permission and after wasting more than 1 month replying back and forth i had to just switch to Intent SEND_SMS and publish the app as it is.

#**Works only in Cyprus**
